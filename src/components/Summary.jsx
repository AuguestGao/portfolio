      <h2>A little bit of me</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a full-stack developer who is curious about almost everything
        especially technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of my curiosity, I find myself always surrounded by ideas,
        challenges, and opportunities, which allowed me to constantly learn
        diverse skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        These learnings equipped me with the necessary set of skills to turn
        ideas into meaningful products that help me and others.
